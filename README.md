# hippobotas
PokemonShowdown chat bot in Py3.


_lasciate ogne speranza, voi châ€™intrate_


A constant WIP. Lots of things need hardening. Style is a mess. Many crucial files are missing here (mainly scripts and data).

Usage below.

## GENERAL

### ]help
Displays a link to this page.

### ]suck [top]
THIS ONLY WORKS IN PMs. Every time anyone gets a point from this command, a random cooldown between 15 minutes and 90 minutes
is generated before it will award points again. Calling it before this cooldown ends results in your points getting reset to 0.

Also gets you banned from the room if @Beowulf is present.
